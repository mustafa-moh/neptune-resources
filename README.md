# Neptune DXP - Open Edition Resources

This repository contains the required development resources and setup process.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up your local development environment, ensure you have:

1. **Docker & Docker Compose**
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running
   - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed (usually included with Docker Desktop)

2. **Neptune DXP Trial License**
   - You need a valid trial license to activate Neptune DXP
   - üìã **[Follow the Trial License Setup Guide](TRIAL_LICENSE_SETUP.md)** to obtain your license
   - This is a free process that takes just a few minutes

## Start Local Development Environment 

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd neptune-resources
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Navigate to the local development directory:

```bash
cd local-development
```

The `.env` file contains all configuration variables. You can modify these values as needed.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Start the Development Environment

Start all services (PostgreSQL database and Neptune DXP):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Verify Services are Running

Check that both containers are up and running:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see both `postgres_db` and `neptune_dxp` containers with status "Up".

### 5. View Logs (Optional)

To monitor the application logs:

```bash
# View all logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View Neptune DXP logs only
docker-compose logs -f neptune

# View PostgreSQL logs only
docker-compose logs -f db
```

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop following logs.

### Accessing the Application

Once the services are running:

- **Neptune DXP Cockpit**: http://localhost:8080
- **PostgreSQL Database**: `localhost:5432`

**First Time Access:**
When you first access the Neptune DXP Cockpit, you'll be prompted to enter your trial license. Have your Trial License ID ready (from the [Trial License Setup Guide](TRIAL_LICENSE_SETUP.md)).


### Stop Services

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

This stops the containers but preserves data.

### Start Stopped Services

```bash
docker-compose start
```

### Restart Services

```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Stop and Remove Containers

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This stops and removes containers but keeps the database volume (data persists).

### Complete Cleanup (Including Data)

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: This removes all data including the PostgreSQL database!
